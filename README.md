# 👋 Hi, I’m @ntvs
## I'm a hard-working developer who loves to learn new tools!

### Interests & skills
I'm interested in learning more about low level programming and back end/API design, but I have more technical skill when it comes to front end programming and visual design.

### What are you learning now?
Kubernetes/developing microservices

### Want to collaborate?
Want to learn more about me and the projects I've worked on? Check out my [personal website](https://www.nickribeiro.com).

<!---
Currently, I'm learning how to make web applications with Vue.js and learning how to port them to the desktop with Electron.js.

ntvs/ntvs is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
