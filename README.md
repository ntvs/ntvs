# 👋 Hi, I’m @ntvs
## I'm a hard-working developer who loves to learn new tools!

### Interests & skills
I'm interested in learning more about low level programming and back end/API design, but I have more technical skill when it comes to front end programming and visual design.

### What are you learning now?
Currently, I'm learning how to make web applications with Vue.js and learning how to port them to the desktop with Electron.js.

### Want to collaborate?
You can learn more about me, the projects I've worked on and see my contact information on my [personal website](https://www.nickribeiro.com).
